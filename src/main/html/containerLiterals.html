<p>Lense recognizes literals for Sequences, Associations and Tuples.
As a rule, because Lense has type inference it must be possible to infer the type of literal from the syntax, so we need a diferent sintax for each container type.


</p>
<pre class="brush: lense">

var Sequence&lt;Natural&gy; sequence = [1, 2, 3];
var Array&lt;Natural&gy; sequence = [1, 2, 3];

</pre>

<p>
The first line creates a sequence of elements 1, 2 and 3.  
The second line creates an array of the elements 1, 2 and 3 by first creating a sequence and them promoting it to an Array. 
</p>

<pre class="brush: lense">

var Association&lt;Natural,Natural&gt;; association = { 1:2, 2:4, 3:6 };
var Map&lt;Natural, Natural&gt;; map = { 1:2, 2:4, 3:6 };

</pre>
 
<p>
The first line creates an association of elements.
The second line creates a map of the same elements by first creating an association and them promoting it to a Map. 
</p>

<pre class="brush: lense">

var Tuple&lt;Natural , Tuple&lt;String, Tuple&lt; Integer, Nothing &gt;&gt;&gt; association = [ 1 : "2" : -3 ];
var [Natural : String : Integer] association = [ 1 : "2" : -3 ];

</pre>

<p>
The first line creates a tuple of elements. A tuple is very similar to a sequence but each index can have it's own type.
The second line creates the same tuple but uses the tuple short type syntax for representing tuple types. The default form used 
in the first line can be very long and odd to write and read eventhought is the exact type of that tuple.
</p>

<p>
Currently there is no special syntax for sets. a set can be created by promoting a literal sequence.
</p>

<pre class="brush: lense">

var Set&lt;Natural&gy; sequence = [1, 2, 3];

</pre>

<p>
There is also not special syntax for record types, eventhought we could devise it to be similar to a map
</p>

<pre class="brush: lense">

var Address address = Address {
	Street = "Baker Street",
	Number = "221B",
	City = "Lodon",
	Country = "England"
}

</pre>


<p>
Also a possible sintax for Matrix is considered, but not currenctly implemented
</p>

<pre class="brush: lense">

var Matrix&lt;Natural&gy; matrix = [ 1 ,2 ,3 ; 4, 5, 6 ; 5 6 7];

// also can be writem like

var Matrix&lt;Natural&gy; matrix = [ 
	1 ,2 ,3 ;
 	4, 5, 6 ; 
 	5, 6, 7
];
</pre>
